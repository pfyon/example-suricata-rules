# Example suricata rules
These are a set of simple (limited snort syntax) and suricata-specific rules to match traffic found in the [Contagio malware pcap collection](https://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2013/04/collection-of-pcap-files-from-malware.html). In some cases, no simple rules can be written to match the traffic and there is only one or more suricata rules.
